# Integrated population model (IPM) for Scandinavian wolverine

This is the development repository for a new integrated population model (IPM) for Scandinavian wolverines. 
The motivation behind developing this model is two-fold: 

1) The IPM will allow making estimates of number of wolverine litters born per year/area based on available monitoring data (as requested by the Norwegian Environmental Directorate).
2) The IPM will constitute the foundation for ongoing and future work on large carnivores involving close-kin mark-recapture methodology

This README will be updated as we progress with model development.
